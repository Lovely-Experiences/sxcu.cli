The directory `cats` is a testing directory, use to test the uploading of images. Feel free to put whatever in this folder, just do not include any changes to it in your pull request if you decide to make one.

> **Note:** sxcu.cli creates a folder called `sxcu.cli` in the current user's home directory.
